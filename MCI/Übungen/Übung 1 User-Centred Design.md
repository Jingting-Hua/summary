# What is [[1.Vorlesung - Einführung#User Centered Design|User-Centred Design]]? – Principles of UCD

- Design is based up on an explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments.
- Users are involved through out design and development.
- Design is driven and refined by user-centred evaluation.
- Process is iterative.
- Design addresses the whole user experience.
- Design team includes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives.

## 概括： 
User-centred design optimises the product around how users can, want, or need to use the product. Users are not forced to change their behaviour and expectations to accommodate the product.

## What problem is addressed by UCD?

- Who？
- What are the users' tasks and goals?
- What are the users' experience levels with the product, and similar products?
- What functions do the users need from the product?
- What information might the users need, and in what form do they need it?
- How do users think the product should work?
- What are the extreme environments in which product can be accessed in?
-  Does the interface utilises different input modes, such as touch, speech, gestures or orientation?

## User-Centred Design vs. Participatory Design

User-Centred Design takes inspiration from the following models:

| User-Centred Design | Cooperative design                                 | Participatory design (PD)                                | Contextual design                                |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
|                     | involving designers and users on an equal footing. | focusing on the participation of users.                  | "customer-centred design" in the actual context, |
|                     | This is also called Co-design. (平等的)            | participants (putative, potential or future) are invited | including some ideas from Participatory design   |
|                     |                                                    |  participate during several stages： define the problem,ideas for solution,evaluate proposed solutions(强调的是阶段性的参与)                                                        |                                                  |
