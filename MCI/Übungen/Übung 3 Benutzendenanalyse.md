# 步骤
在这个阶段我们需要分析系统的需求和重要的目标
- Elaborate system requirements by analysing the users
- Which are the user classification dimensions?
	- culture,
	- age,
	- impairments,
	- characteristics,
- Create user stereotypes (Personas)
- What do the users need?
- What do the users want?

## Agile Software Development – UCD in Agile Iteration

- Context and user analysis focussed on the specific system artefact.
- Design phase: The actual Agile Iteration (implement the system)
- Evaluation phase is interpretable as kind-of unit test related to the artefact that is developed during the iteration.

- Context and user analysis based on Evaluation the whole system.
- Design phase is represented by the Construction phase of the Agile Lifecycle.
- Evaluation phase is interpretable as kind-of integration test for the whole system
