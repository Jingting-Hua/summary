## Data Mining

„Data Mining, as we use the term, is the exploration and analysis, by automatic or semiautomatic means, of large quantities of data in order to discover meaningful patterns and rules “

## Analytics

- Analytics is the process of introspecting data to discover <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">hidden patterns</mark>, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">meaningful relationships</mark>, and <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">interesting associations</mark> which can be converted into actionable insights

- By analytics we mean the extensive use of data, statistical and quantitative analysis, explanatory and predictive models, and factbased management to drive decisions and actions. The analytics may be input for human decisions or may drive fully automated decisions

### Different Types of Analytics

|                     | What is happening?    | Why is it happening/what should we do? |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Looking at past/now | Descriptive Analytics | Diagnostic Analytics                   |
| Looking at future   | Predictive Analytics  | Prescriptive Analytics                                       |


#### Descriptive Analytics

- Question: “What is happening right now/ what happened in the past?”
- Summarizing collected data from various sources and providing aggregated measures and visualizations Including traditional business intelligence tools: e.g. reports, dashboards, querying, online analytical processing (OLAP)


#### Diagnostic Analytics

- Question: “Why did/ does it happen?”
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Explanatory empirical modeling</mark> based on statistical inference and causal hypotheses testing Often used in research & development
- 
#### Predictive Analytics
- Question: “What is likely to happen?”
- Developing<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> prediction models</mark> with high accuracy by using a large amount of historical data, detecting complex and non-trivial relationships and providing predictions and equivalent probability scores on new unclassified observations
- 

#### Prescriptive Analytics

- Questions: “What should be done / why should it be done?”
- Mathematical techniques (e.g. optimization, simulation) that computationally determine a set of high-value alternative actions or decisions given a complex set of objectives, requirements and constraints

## Machine Learning
- Goal: Generalize the experience in a way that allows to improve your performance on the task.
 - a task T,
 - a performance measure P,
 - some experience E with the task
### Supervised Learning:
- The algorithm is given training data which contains examples of the input vectors along with their corresponding<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> target vectors as the “correct answer”</mark> and the goal is to learn a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">general rule/ model</mark> that maps inputs to outputs.
- 有标准答案，有反馈

- Examples: classification, regression


### Unsupervised Learning:

- Principle: <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">No labels (i.e., target values) are given to the algorithm</mark>, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal by itself (discovering hidden patterns) or a means towards a supervised approach (feature learning).
- 没有标准答案，没有反馈
- Examples: cluster analysis, dimensionality reduction, density estimation


### Reinforcement Learning

problem of finding suitable actions to take, in a given situation in order to maximize a reward (奖罚分明). Here the learning algorithm is not given examples of optimal outputs, in contrast to supervised learning, but must instead discover them by a process of <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">trial and error</mark>. Typically, there is a sequence of states and actions in which the learning algorithm is interacting with its environment
